        We're really excited for you to join this community!

        As a teacher you have full access to view all reviews across
        all programs! We hope that you can regularly read your own 
        reviews and report any/all issues students are running into
        back to the curriculum team so that this school can run 
        seamlessly and efficiently while also giving students the 
        best possible experience!
